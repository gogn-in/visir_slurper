## Visir news slurper

A scrapy crawler that crawls http://visir.is news articles and saves them

Each article is saved in three files:

{title}.json - metadata info on the article

{title}.txt - the text of the article

{title}.html.gz - the untouched html of the article


Articles can either be saved by author or by date of the article.
